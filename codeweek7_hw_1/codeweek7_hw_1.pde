// this is the "Cookie" class sketch we wrote in class.

// create 2 or more additional class definitions. 
// these classes aren't used for actually programming any visuals so they can 
//  be totally abstract and print text only just as the Cookie class does. 

// The first new class you make should represent some other kind of common object.
// give it fields and methods, as well as a custom constructor.
// The second new class you create should have its own object instance of the Cookie 
//  (or other) class. For example, maybe a Cookie Jar class would have an 
//  ArrayList of type Cookie.
